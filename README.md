# A program to image playback by interpolating polynomials
Simple program which uses interpolation to image playback

Reads an PNG file, finds pixels that arenâ€™t white, based on selected ones interpolates functions responsible for the X and Y coordinates ( Sx(t) and Sy(t) ) and creates a plot (parametric curve) imitating the image.
